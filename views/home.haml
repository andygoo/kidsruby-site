    %h1 KidsRuby Loves Raspberry Pi! Introducing Support For The New $25 Kids Computer
    %time{:datetime => '2011-09-16', :pubdate => ''} Friday, Sep. 16th, 2011
    %p
      We are extremely excited to announce that we have KidsRuby running on the new <a href="http://raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi $25 computer</a>. The result of the hard work of a dedicated team located in the U.K., the Raspberry Pi uses an inexpensive ARM processor to bring the price of a computer down to an amazing new level. The first alpha version shown in public in the United States took place at the Golden Gate Ruby Conference during Ron Evans(<a href="http://twitter.com/deadprogram">@deadprogram</a>)'s opening talk on Sept. 16, the day before Raspberry Pi's more formal introduction at <a href="http://makerfaire.com/pub/e/7148">Maker Faire NYC</a>. You can watch the complete <a href="http://confreaks.net/videos/637-gogaruco2011-kidsruby-think-of-the-children">video of the talk on KidsRuby and Raspberry Pi here</a>. KidsRuby being able to support the Raspberry Pi opens up many new possibilities for helping teach the next generation of programmers, and we are delighted to be working together!<br />

    %h1 What do you exactly mean by "hack your homework"?
    %time{:datetime => '2011-01-14', :pubdate => ''} Friday, Jan. 14th, 2011
    %p When we say "hack your homework" we mean "learn how to write a computer program to help you with your homework". For example, writing code to solve a particular math problem. By showing kids that programming can apply to the real world, like any subject, it becomes a lot more interesting to learn about.
    %p The term "hack" in the computer world, means to be able to do something with hardware or software that the original designers did not realize could be done, usually in a good way. This term is often confused with the term "crack" which means to bypass security of some kind, usually considered something bad that you do not wish to do.

    %h1 A little more detail?
    %time{:datetime => '2011-01-14', :pubdate => ''} Friday, Jan. 14th, 2011
    %p KidsRuby provides a way that kids can use the awesome programming language Ruby to learn how to write their own software. While using a simple interface, it still lets them explore the full capabilities of the Ruby language.
    %p In addition to providing a full Ruby programming environment for kids, we also have a complete KidsRuby operating system based on Ubuntu Linux that makes it easy for kids to learn how to program in Ruby on any computer. And it will let them do it anywhere they go, just bring their own USB drive, plug in, and reboot.
