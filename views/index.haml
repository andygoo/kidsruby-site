    %h1 What do you exactly mean by "hack your homework"?
    %p When we say "hack your homework" we mean "learn how to write a computer program to help you with your homework". For example, writing code to solve a particular math problem. By showing kids that programming can apply to the real world, like any subject, it becomes a lot more interesting to learn about.
    %p The term "hack" in the computer world, means to be able to do something with hardware or software that the original designers did not realize could be done, usually in a good way. This term is often confused with the term "crack" with means to bypass security of some kind, usually considered something bad that you do not wish to do.

    %h1 A little more detail? 
    %p We are working on a free linux distribution that makes it easy for kids to learn how to program in Ruby.
    %p KidsRuby will provide a way that kids can use the awesome programming language Ruby to learn how to write their own software. And it will let them do it anywhere they go, just bring their own USB drive, plug in, and reboot.
