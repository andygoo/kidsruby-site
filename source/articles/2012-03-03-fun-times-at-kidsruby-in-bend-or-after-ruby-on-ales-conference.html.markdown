<p class="article">
	We had a fun and well-attended KidsRuby class on Mar. 3, 2012 in Bend, OR. in cooperation with the Ruby On Ales Conference 2012 (<a href="http://ruby.onales.com/">http://ruby.onales.com/</a>). Despite the snow on the ground, it was warm inside, and we had some of the most creative turtle graphics art yet. Great job from all the young programmers!
