<p class="article">
	New Orleans, LA was the location of our KidsRuby class in cooperation with the <a href="http://rubyconf.org">International Ruby Conference (RubyConf)</a>. The Sunday after RubyConf was a beautiful day for code, and kids filled up all the space we had available. Thank you <a href="http://launchpadnola.com/">Launchpad NOLA</a> for sharing their office space with the kids of New Orleans. Thanks also to <a href="http://www.bluebox.net/">Blue Box Group</a> for donating USB drives, and of course special thanks to the volunteers!
