	Our brand new 1.2 release of KidsRuby has gone international, now with full Japanese, French, and Spanish translations. That means our unique and fun way to learn programming has been localized so even more kids all over the world can have fun coding in in Ruby. Thank you to the translators and dev team who helped make this new release possible!
