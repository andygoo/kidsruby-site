<p class="article">
	We taught our first class using nothing but KidsRuby in Los Angeles on February 4th, in cooperation with the Los Angeles Ruby Conference (<a href="http://larubyconf.com">LARubyConf</a>). It was really an excellent class, and everyone had a great time and learned about Ruby. Thank you very much to the students, teachers, and especially the KidsRuby dev team for working so hard to get that first version of KidsRuby ready in time for the class.
