	Happy happy joy joy! We've gone to release 1.0 of KidsRuby, and we have a new website design too. Plus, as a special treat we now include the Ruby programming learning game <a href="https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior">RubyWarrior</a> along with KidsRuby. Learning to program with Ruby is now more fun than ever! Thank you so very much to the dev team and our testers for helping us make this 1.0 release possible. Enjoy!
