	On Saturday, June 11, we were demoing KidsRuby and also bringing Flying Robots #4 & #5 to the Pasadena Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) Expo. Put together by the remarkable efforts of Erik Dreyer of Pasadena Robotics, the combination expo and robotics competition was lots of fun for all. We were doing UAV overflights with our video camera, as well as students fly the blimps. We WILL be posting video, rest assured! If you were there, thank you for sharing the geeky fun with Pasadena/Los Angeles. There is more info <a href="http://www.pasedfoundation.org/parentsstudents/2011-robotics-competition/">available here</a> about the expo.
