<p class="article">
	We held a KidsRuby class in Bend, Oregon on March 26th, in cooperation with the <a href="http://ruby.onales.com">Ruby On Ales Conference</a>. A fantastic class, and a very fun morning. We had a great venue provided by G5 (<a href="http://www.g5platform.com/">http://www.g5platform.com/</a> thanks guys!) and an amazing turnout. There were also lots of local Rubyists out to help the class, which was good because there were lots of kids ready to have fun with Ruby. Thank you everyone for making it a great event!
