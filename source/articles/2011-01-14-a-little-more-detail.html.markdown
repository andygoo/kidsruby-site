	In addition to providing a full Ruby programming environment for kids, we also have a complete KidsRuby operating system based on Ubuntu Linux that makes it easy for kids to learn how to program in Ruby on any computer. And it will let them do it anywhere they go, just bring their own USB drive, plug in, and reboot.
