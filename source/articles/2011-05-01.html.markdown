	Last Sunday, May 1, we held another KidsRuby class in Los Angeles, California, in cooperation with <a href="http://barcampla.org">BarCampLA</a>. It was another great turnout, with even a few "big kids" from Barcamp joining in as both teachers and students. Thank you to everyone who helped make it happen, kids programming is awesome!
