	We had a fantastic KidsRuby class at the <a href="http://kidscodecamp.com/">KidsCodeCamp</a> that took place on May 19 in Pasadena, CA in participation with the massive Pasadena STEM Expo 2012 event! Hundreds of kids were in attendance, between our packed classes, the robotics competitions, and the separate exibition hall. Robots everywhere!
