<p class="article">
	We are extremely excited to announce that we have KidsRuby running on the new <a href="http://raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi $25 computer</a>. The result of the hard work of a dedicated team located in the U.K., the Raspberry Pi uses an inexpensive ARM processor to bring the price of a computer down to an amazing new level. The first alpha version shown in public in the United States took place at the Golden Gate Ruby Conference during Ron Evans(<a href="http://twitter.com/deadprogram">@deadprogram</a>)'s opening talk on Sept. 16, the day before Raspberry Pi's more formal introduction at <a href="http://makerfaire.com/pub/e/7148">Maker Faire NYC</a>. You can watch the complete <a href="http://confreaks.net/videos/637-gogaruco2011-kidsruby-think-of-the-children">video of the talk on KidsRuby and Raspberry Pi here</a>. KidsRuby being able to support the Raspberry Pi opens up many new possibilities for helping teach the next generation of programmers, and we are delighted to be working together!
