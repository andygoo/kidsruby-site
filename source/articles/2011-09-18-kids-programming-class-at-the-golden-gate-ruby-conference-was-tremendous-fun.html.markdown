<p class="article">
	We held a really fantastic class using KidsRuby in San Francisco, California on Sunday, September 18, in cooperation with the <a href="http://gogaruco.com">Golden Gate Ruby Conference</a> which was held on September 16th & 17th. Special thank you to <a href="http://twitter.com/sarahmei">Sarah Mei</a> for helping organize it, <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs</a> for sharing their office space with the kids of San Francisco, and especially all of the volunteers that came out and helped with the class.
