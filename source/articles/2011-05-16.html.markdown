	On Monday, May 16, KidsRuby came to Baltimore, Maryland to hold another awesome kids programming class, in cooperation with <a href="http://bohconf.com">BohConf 2011</a> and <a href="http://www.railsconf.com">RailsConf 2011</a>. This was one of our best events yet, with an amazing group of young people who came in from Digital Harbor HS each equipped with their own school-issued MacBooks, no less. Go, Baltimore! Local civic leader and Rubyist <a href="http://davetroy.com/">Dave Troy</a> was also in attendance, with his kids in town. Thank you so very much to everyone who helped out with the class, especially the teachers from Digital Harbor, your efforts are appreciated!
