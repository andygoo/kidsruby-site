	When we say "hack your homework" we mean "learn how to write a computer program to help you with your homework". For example, writing code to solve a particular math problem. By showing kids that programming can apply to the real world, like any subject, it becomes a lot more interesting to learn about.

	The term "hack" in the computer world, means to be able to do something with hardware or software that the original designers did not realize could be done, usually in a good way. This term is often confused with the term "crack" which means to bypass security of some kind, usually considered something bad that you do not wish to do.
