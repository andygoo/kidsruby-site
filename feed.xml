	We've just released the latest KidsRuby version 1.3, and we're very excited to announce built-in support for the Sphero robotic ball from Orbotix (&lt;a href="http://gosphero.com/" target="blank"&gt;http://gosphero.com/&lt;/a&gt;). If you were at RubyConf in Denver you might have seen the preview, and now we've got everything you need to get started learning about the wonderful world of robotics! Support for more robots coming soon...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="article"&gt;
	In addition, we now have the standalone KidsRuby Installer for Raspberry Pi (Raspbian), and KidsRuby Installer for Debian, including Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux versions. Get them while they're hot from our download page at &lt;a href="http://kidsruby.com/download.html"&gt;http://kidsruby.com/download.html&lt;/a&gt;.

	Our brand new 1.2 release of KidsRuby has gone international, now with full Japanese, French, and Spanish translations. That means our unique and fun way to learn programming has been localized so even more kids all over the world can have fun coding in in Ruby. Thank you to the translators and dev team who helped make this new release possible!

	We had a fun and well-attended KidsRuby class on Mar. 3, 2012 in Bend, OR. in cooperation with the Ruby On Ales Conference 2012 (&lt;a href="http://ruby.onales.com/"&gt;http://ruby.onales.com/&lt;/a&gt;). Despite the snow on the ground, it was warm inside, and we had some of the most creative turtle graphics art yet. Great job from all the young programmers!
